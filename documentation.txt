HubSlacker - CS50 User Guide

To run HubSlacker locally follow the directions below.  

Please note: when running the live app, it may take a moment for the server to respond, I am using a free version of Heroku for hosting and it will put the app to sleep every 18 minutes it's not in use.  Additionally, the implementation required in HubSpot does not run in conjunction with localhost, so even if you are running the app on a localhost, webhooks will be routed through the live app.


1) Download the latest version of Node.js (HubSlacker uses ES6 template literals, and without the latest version of Node, the app will not run).
2) From the command line navigate into the hubslacker directory and execute the following:
	>node index.js
3) Wait for the output:
	>app is running on port 5000
	>Mongoose default connection opened to: @ds011241.mlab.com:11241/heroku_53k0b7qs
4) Open a web browser and go to localhost:5000

(I didn't test this on a PC. so I'm not sure if there is additional setup related to the node modules on a PC)
